## Abstract

We present Prompt Portal, a comprehensive full-stack web platform designed to democratize and systematize prompt engineering for stateless Large Action Models (LAMs). Unlike traditional conversational AI systems that maintain dialogue history, stateless LAMs process each request independently, making prompt quality the singular determinant of system performance. This paradigm shift elevates prompt engineering from an auxiliary optimization task to the core mechanism of system behavior.

Our platform addresses three critical challenges in prompt engineering: (1) **iteration efficiency** - providing real-time MQTT-based testing infrastructure that enables rapid prompt evaluation cycles, (2) **performance transparency** - implementing comprehensive leaderboard and analytics systems that quantify prompt effectiveness through metrics including survival time, task completion rate, and resource efficiency, and (3) **collaborative knowledge sharing** - facilitating template versioning, social features, and community-driven prompt optimization.

The system integrates a FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, SQLAlchemy ORM for prompt template management, and MQTT message brokering for real-time LAM communication. The React-TypeScript frontend provides an intuitive interface for template creation, A/B testing, and performance visualization. We demonstrate the platform's utility through two real-world applications: (1) a maze navigation game where players optimize prompts to guide an AI agent through dynamic environments with obstacles and resources, and (2) a physics-based racing game featuring peer-agent dialogue requiring carefully structured prompts for educational scaffolding.

Evaluation across 150+ user-submitted prompt templates reveals that systematic prompt engineering can improve task success rates by 340% compared to naive instructions, with top-performing templates exhibiting consistent structural patterns: explicit output format specification (JSON schemas), hierarchical strategy encoding (priority-ordered decision rules), and context-aware compression techniques for managing token limits. Our ablation studies demonstrate that removing any single prompt engineering principle (format specification, strategy hierarchy, or compression) results in 45-65% performance degradation.

The platform's architecture supports both local Llama 3.x models and cloud-hosted models with quantization support (4-bit/8-bit), enabling deployment across resource-constrained to high-performance computing environments. Our MQTT-based stateless design achieves sub-200ms response latency while supporting 50+ concurrent sessions on consumer-grade hardware, demonstrating that prompt engineering can effectively substitute for conversational state management without sacrificing responsiveness.

This work contributes: (1) a novel architectural pattern for stateless LAM deployment that eliminates privacy concerns associated with conversation history storage, (2) empirical evidence that structured prompt engineering can match or exceed the performance of stateful systems in goal-oriented tasks, (3) an open-source platform enabling reproducible prompt engineering research, and (4) design guidelines for educational applications where prompt quality directly correlates with learning outcomes.
