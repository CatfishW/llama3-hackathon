# üö® URGENT: Steps to Fix Driving Game Leaderboard

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ Database has **0 driving_game scores** (verified)
- ‚úÖ Database has **1010 total scores** (979 manual + 31 lam)
- ‚ùå Frontend shows **1356 entries** in Driving Game view
- **Problem:** Frontend is showing cached/wrong data

---

## üîç Step 1: Test the API Directly

### Open the Test Page:
1. Open this file in your browser:
```
Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\test_leaderboard.html
```

2. It will automatically test the Driving Game API

3. **Expected Result:**
   ```
   ‚úì‚úì‚úì CORRECT! Driving Game mode returns 0 entries!
   The API is working correctly. The problem is in the frontend.
   ```

4. **If you see this** ‚Üí Problem is frontend caching
5. **If you see error** ‚Üí Problem is backend not running correctly

---

## üîß Step 2: Clear Browser Cache COMPLETELY

### Option A: Hard Clear (Recommended)
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Cookies and site data
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files
4. Click "Clear data"
5. **Close ALL browser windows**
6. Reopen browser

### Option B: Developer Tools
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Clear storage" (left sidebar)
4. Click "Clear site data" button
5. Refresh with `Ctrl + Shift + R`

---

## üîç Step 3: Check Browser Console

1. Open your leaderboard page
2. Press `F12`
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Click "Driving Game" button
5. Look for these messages:
```
[LEADERBOARD] Loading with mode: driving_game, initial: true
[API] Calling: /api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
[API] Response total: 0 entries: 0
[LEADERBOARD] Received 0 entries, total: 0
```

### If you see "mode: driving_game" and "total: 0"
‚úÖ Everything is working! Just clear your cache.

### If you see "mode: lam" or different numbers
‚ùå Frontend code not updated. Need to rebuild.

---

## üöÄ Step 4: Rebuild & Deploy Frontend (If Needed)

### If console shows wrong mode or old data:

```powershell
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\frontend

# Clear node_modules cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist

# Rebuild (ignore TestMQTT/WebGame errors - they're unrelated)
npm run build

# The build will have warnings but will still work for Leaderboard
```

### Copy new build to production:
```powershell
# If using a web server, copy the dist folder
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force dist\* <your-web-server-path>
```

---

## üî¨ Step 5: Verify in Network Tab

1. Open browser, press `F12`
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh leaderboard page
4. Click "Driving Game" button
5. Find the `leaderboard` request
6. Check the URL - should be:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
```

7. Check the Response:
   - Should be: `[]` (empty array)
   - X-Total-Count header: `0`

---

## üìä What Should Happen After Fix

| Mode | Expected |
|------|----------|
| **Driving Game** | 0 entries, "No entries yet" message |
| **LAM Mode** | 31 entries |
| **Manual Mode** | 979 entries |

---

## üêõ If STILL Not Working

### Check 1: Is backend running the NEW code?
```powershell
# Stop backend completely
# (Find Python process in Task Manager and END it)

# Start fresh
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\backend
python run_server.py
```

### Check 2: Multiple browser tabs?
- Close ALL tabs with the leaderboard
- Open ONE new tab
- Test again

### Check 3: Different database?
```powershell
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\backend
python check_db_now.py
```
Should show:
```
lam    : 31
manual : 979
Driving Game scores: 0
```
