| **Backtrack Ratio** | ‚â§ 10% | -1000 pts max | Penalty for revisiting tiles |
| **Collision Rate** | = 0 | -1500 pts max | Penalty for hitting walls |
| **Avg Latency** | ‚â§ 400 ms | +1000 / -800 pts | Decision speed bonus/penalty |
| **Oxygen Collection** | More is better | 150 pts each | Resource gathering bonus |
| **Time Deduction** | Faster is better | -1 per 10 sec | Continuous time penalty |
| **Speed Bonus** | < 60 seconds | Up to 1000 pts | Fast completion reward |

## Multipliers

| Factor | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|

| **Manual Mode** | 1.0x | Player-controlled baseline |
| **Germ Factor** | 1.0x - 1.3x | More germs = higher multiplier |

√ó Germ Factor (1.2): 18,907 points
```

### Average Run (Manual Mode)
```
Base: 5000
Success: 2000
Path Efficiency (0.70): 1050
Backtrack Penalty (15%): -250
Oxygen (3 collected): 450
Speed Bonus (90 sec): 0
Time Deduction (90 sec): -9
Total before multipliers: 8,241
√ó Manual Mode (1.0): 8,241
√ó Germ Factor (1.1): 9,065 points
```

### Failed Run
```
Base: 0 (no win)
Success: 0
Oxygen (2 collected): 300
Collision Penalty: -600
Time Deduction (45 sec): -5
Total: -305 ‚Üí 0 points (minimum)
```

## Tips to Maximize Score

### üéØ Path Efficiency
- Plan your route before moving
- Use LAM hints in LAM mode
- Minimize backtracking

### ‚ö° Speed
- Act quickly but carefully
- Time deduction is continuous (-1 per 10 sec)
- Finish under 60 seconds for speed bonus

### üõ°Ô∏è Avoid Penalties
- Don't hit walls (collision penalty)
- Don't revisit tiles (backtrack penalty)
- Keep action latency under 400ms

### üí∞ Maximize Bonuses
- Collect all oxygen (+150 each)
- Play LAM mode for 1.5x multiplier
- More germs = higher difficulty = higher multiplier

## Metric Ranges

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|------|
| Path Efficiency | > 0.90 | 0.85-0.90 | 0.70-0.85 | < 0.70 |
| Backtrack Ratio | 0% | < 5% | 5-10% | > 10% |
| Collision Count | 0 | 1-2 | 3-5 | > 5 |
| Avg Latency | < 300ms | 300-400ms | 400-600ms | > 600ms |
| Completion Time | < 40s | 40-60s | 60-90s | > 90s |

## Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Rating | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 15,000+ | üèÜ Exceptional | Near-perfect run with high efficiency |
| 10,000-15,000 | ‚≠ê Excellent | Very good performance, few mistakes |
| 7,000-10,000 | üëç Good | Solid completion with room for improvement |
| 5,000-7,000 | ‚úÖ Average | Completed but inefficiently |
| 2,000-5,000 | üìä Below Average | Many penalties or very slow |
| 0-2,000 | üíÄ Poor | Failed or very inefficient |

## Legacy vs New Scoring

### Old System (Deprecated)
- Simple: oxygen + win bonus + time bonus
- Limited feedback
- Less fair for difficult mazes

### New System
- Comprehensive: 10+ factors considered
- Detailed performance metrics
- Fairer across different difficulty levels
- Continuous time pressure
- Better competitive balance

## Migration Note

All historical scores are preserved as "Deprecated Score" in the leaderboard. New scores will be calculated using the comprehensive system and displayed as "New Score" with metrics.
