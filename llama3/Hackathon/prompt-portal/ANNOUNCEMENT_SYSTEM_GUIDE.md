## Best Practices

### For Admins

1. **Keep it concise**: Users see announcements for 5 seconds
2. **Use appropriate types**: Match severity to announcement type
3. **Set priorities**: Important messages should have higher priority
4. **Use expiration**: Remove time-sensitive announcements automatically
5. **Test first**: Create a low-priority test announcement

### Example Use Cases

- **System Updates**: "üöÄ New chat feature now available!"
- **Maintenance**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Scheduled maintenance tonight 10 PM - 12 AM"
- **Events**: "üéâ Join our community game tournament this weekend!"
- **Issues**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Some features may be slow due to high traffic"

## Troubleshooting

### Announcements not showing?

- Check if announcement is **active**
- Verify **expiration date** hasn't passed
- Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('dismissedAnnouncements')`
- Refresh the page

### Can't access admin panel?

- Verify you're logged in with `1819409756@qq.com`
- Check backend logs for permission errors
- Ensure database migration ran successfully

### API errors?

- Check backend server is running
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Development Notes

The announcement system is fully integrated with:
- FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- React frontend with TypeScript
- JWT authentication for admin access
- SQLite database (easily portable to PostgreSQL)

Admin access is hardcoded to `1819409756@qq.com` in:
- `backend/app/routers/announcements.py` (line 11)

To change the admin email, update the `ADMIN_EMAIL` constant.
