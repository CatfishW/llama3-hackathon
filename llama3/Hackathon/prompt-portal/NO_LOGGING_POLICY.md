# No Logging Policy

This application has been configured with a strict **NO LOGGING** policy for enhanced security and user privacy.

## What Has Been Removed/Disabled

### Backend Logging
- ✅ Removed `log_level="info"` from `run_server.py`
- ✅ Disabled logging configuration in `alembic/env.py`
- ✅ Replaced logging configuration in `alembic.ini` with disabled settings
- ✅ All database migration logs are suppressed

### System Monitoring
- ✅ Removed log file creation in `deploy-production.sh` monitoring script
- ✅ Removed log file creation in `setup-mqtt.sh` monitoring script
- ✅ Disabled all MQTT logging in Mosquitto broker configuration
- ✅ Replaced log viewing functionality in `manage.sh` with security message

### Frontend Logging
- ✅ Removed all `console.log()` statements from React components
- ✅ Removed all `console.error()` statements from React components
- ✅ Removed all `console.debug()` statements from React components
- ✅ Replaced with silent error handling or informative comments

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated README.md to mention logging policy
- ✅ Updated deployment scripts to note logging is disabled
- ✅ Updated management tools to inform users about no-logging policy

## Security Benefits

1. **No Data Leakage**: No sensitive user data or application state is stored in log files
2. **Privacy Protection**: User actions and interactions are not tracked or recorded
3. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Log files cannot be exploited by attackers
4. **Compliance Ready**: Meets strict privacy requirements for sensitive applications

## Debugging Alternatives

For development and troubleshooting:
- Use real-time monitoring with `systemctl status`
- Use `pm2 status` for process monitoring
- Monitor database state directly through admin tools
- Use browser developer tools for frontend debugging (in development only)
