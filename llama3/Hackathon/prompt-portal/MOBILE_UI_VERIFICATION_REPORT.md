## Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Safe Area Support
- **Limitation**: Only works on iOS 11+ and Android 4.4+
- **Mitigation**: Older devices fallback to normal padding
- **Status**: Acceptable (covers 99%+ of devices)

### CSS Media Queries
- **Limitation**: CSS-based, not pixel-perfect JavaScript detection
- **Mitigation**: `useIsMobile` hook provides JS-based detection
- **Status**: Excellent coverage (combined approach)

### Landscape Mode
- **Limitation**: Very small height (≤600px) requires careful layout
- **Mitigation**: CSS handles keyboard overlap, content scrolls
- **Status**: Well-handled with proper UX

## Recommendations for Future

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. Monitor real user metrics on mobile
2. Gather user feedback on mobile UX
3. Fix any reported issues
4. Optimize based on analytics

### Medium Term (2-3 Sprints)
1. Add PWA support
2. Implement offline capabilities
3. Add mobile gesture support
4. Performance monitoring

### Long Term
1. Native mobile app (React Native)
2. Advanced touch interactions
3. Voice input support
4. Mobile-specific features
