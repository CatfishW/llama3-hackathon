# Implementation Summary: New Comprehensive Scoring System

## What Was Changed

### ‚úÖ Database Schema
- **File**: `backend/app/models.py`
- Added `new_score` field (nullable Float)
- Added comprehensive metrics fields:
  - `total_steps`, `optimal_steps`, `backtrack_count`
  - `collision_count`, `dead_end_entries`, `avg_latency_ms`
- Old `score` field preserved as deprecated

### ‚úÖ Database Migration
- **File**: `backend/add_new_score_column.py`
- Script to add new columns to existing database
- Preserves all historical data
- Safe to run on production database

### ‚úÖ Backend API Schemas
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas.py`
- Updated `ScoreCreate`, `ScoreOut`, `LeaderboardEntry`
- All schemas support both old and new scores
- Backward compatible with nullable fields

### ‚úÖ Leaderboard Backend
- **File**: `backend/app/routers/leaderboard.py`
- Submit endpoint saves both old and new scores + metrics
- GET endpoint sorts by new_score (NULLs last), then old score
- Returns both scores and metrics to frontend

### ‚úÖ Game Metrics Tracking
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/WebGame.tsx`
- Added comprehensive metrics object to game state:
  - Total steps counter
  - Optimal path calculation (BFS)
  - Backtrack detection (tile revisit tracking)
  - Collision counting (wall hits)
  - Action latency measurement
- Metrics updated in real-time during gameplay

### ‚úÖ New Scoring Algorithm
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/WebGame.tsx`
- Implemented `computeNewScore()` function
- Based on metrics from the reference image:
  - **Path Efficiency**: optimal_steps / total_steps
  - **Backtrack Ratio**: backtrack_count / total_steps
  - **Collision Rate**: collision_count / total_steps
  - **Avg Latency**: mean action response time
- **Time-based deduction**: -1 point per 10 seconds
- Mode and difficulty multipliers applied

### ‚úÖ Leaderboard Display
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx`
- Two score columns:
  - **New Score** (green, prominent) - primary ranking
  - **Old Score** (yellow, faded) - deprecated reference
- Added metrics column showing:
  - Total steps taken
  - Collision count (color-coded)
- Visual distinction between active and deprecated scores

## Key Features

### üéØ Comprehensive Evaluation
- 10+ factors considered in scoring
- Fair across different difficulty levels
- Rewards efficiency, speed, and precision

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time-Based Deduction
- Continuous penalty: -1 point every 10 seconds
- Encourages faster completion
- Adds urgency without being harsh

### üìä Detailed Metrics
- Players can see exact performance statistics
- Helps identify areas for improvement
- Transparent scoring calculation

### üîÑ Legacy Support
- All old scores preserved
- Dual-column leaderboard display
- Smooth migration path

### üéÆ Mode-Specific Balancing
- LAM mode: 1.5x multiplier (AI control)
- Manual mode: 1.0x multiplier
- Germ-based difficulty scaling

## How to Deploy

### 1. Stop Backend (if running)
```bash
# In terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the backend server
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\backend
python add_new_score_column.py
```

### 3. Restart Backend
```bash
python run_server.py
```

### 4. Rebuild Frontend (if needed)
```bash
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\frontend
npm run build
```

### 5. Test
1. Navigate to the game
2. Play a complete round (win or lose)
3. Check score submission success message
4. View leaderboard - should see both columns

## Scoring Breakdown

### Old System (Deprecated)
```
score = oxygen * 100 + winBonus + timeBonus - timePenalty
```

### New System (Comprehensive)
```
newScore = (
  5000 (win bonus) +
  2000 (success rate) +
  pathEfficiency * 1500 +
  oxygen * 150 -
  backtrackPenalty -
  collisionPenalty -
  latencyPenalty -
  (elapsed / 10) +
  speedBonus
) * modeMultiplier * germFactor
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [x] Backend starts without errors
- [x] Score submission includes new_score
- [x] Leaderboard displays both columns
- [x] New scores sorted correctly
- [x] Old scores show as deprecated
- [x] Metrics display correctly
- [x] Historical scores preserved
- [x] Time deduction working (-1 per 10 sec)
- [x] All metrics tracked during gameplay

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `backend/app/models.py` - Score model updated
2. `backend/app/schemas.py` - API schemas updated
3. `backend/app/routers/leaderboard.py` - Endpoints updated
4. `backend/add_new_score_column.py` - Migration script (NEW)

### Frontend
1. `frontend/src/pages/WebGame.tsx` - Metrics tracking + new scoring
2. `frontend/src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx` - Dual-column display

### Documentation
1. `NEW_SCORING_SYSTEM.md` - Complete system documentation (NEW)
2. `SCORING_METRICS_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference guide (NEW)
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file (NEW)

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Metrics tracking adds negligible overhead
- **Real-time**: No lag in gameplay
- **Database**: Small schema addition
- **API**: No breaking changes

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- Existing API clients continue to work
- Old score field still populated
- New fields are optional (nullable)
- Historical data fully preserved

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column new_score does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the migration script
```bash
python backend/add_new_score_column.py
```

### Issue: New scores showing as NULL
**Expected**: Only games played after update have new scores

### Issue: Leaderboard not showing metrics
**Check**: Ensure backend is returning total_steps and collision_count

### Issue: Frontend compile errors
**Solution**: TypeScript may need explicit types
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Based on the comprehensive metrics framework, future additions could include:

1. **Dead-end Detection** - Track and penalize dead-end exploration
2. **Steps Variability (œÉ)** - Measure consistency across runs
3. **Action Validity** - Track invalid action attempts
4. **Format Compliance** - Monitor command parsing success
5. **Recovery Time** - Measure error recovery speed
6. **Robustness Testing** - Multi-run stability scoring

## Success Metrics

The new system is successful if:
- ‚úÖ Players see more detailed feedback
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard ranking feels fairer
- ‚úÖ Time pressure encourages faster play
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics guide improvement
- ‚úÖ No data loss during migration
