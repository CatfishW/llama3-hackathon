# üîç FINAL DEBUG - Find Why It's Not Working

## Current Situation
- Database has 1010 scores (979 manual + 31 lam, 0 driving_game) ‚úì
- All columns added ‚úì
- Backend code updated ‚úì
- **BUT frontend still shows 1356 entries!**

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Restart Backend with Logging

### Stop the current backend completely
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running
2. OR go to Task Manager ‚Üí Find Python process ‚Üí End Task

### Start backend fresh
```powershell
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\backend
python run_server.py
```

Watch the console - it will now print detailed logs.

---

## üîç Step 2: Test and Watch Logs

### In your browser:
1. Go to Leaderboard page
2. **Watch the backend console**
3. Click "Driving Game" button
4. **Look at what the backend prints**

### You should see something like:
```
======================================================================
[LEADERBOARD API CALLED]
  mode parameter: 'driving_game'
  limit: 50, skip: 0
======================================================================
[FILTER APPLIED] Filtering by mode=driving_game
[TOTAL COUNT] 0 scores match the filter
```

---

## üìä What the Logs Will Tell Us

### Case A: If you see `mode parameter: 'driving_game'` and `TOTAL COUNT: 0`
‚úÖ Backend is working correctly!
‚ùå Problem is in the frontend caching

**Solution:**
- Try a different browser (Edge if using Chrome, or vice versa)
- Or use Incognito/Private mode
- Frontend has stale data that won't clear

### Case B: If you see `mode parameter: 'None'` or `mode parameter: ''`
‚ùå Frontend is NOT sending the mode parameter

**Solution:**
- Frontend needs to be rebuilt
- The new code isn't being used

### Case C: If you see `mode parameter: 'driving_game'` but `TOTAL COUNT: 1010`
‚ùå Backend filter isn't working

**Solution:**
- Database might have different structure than expected
- Need to check the actual query

---

## üî¨ Step 3: Check Browser Network Tab

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Click "Driving Game" button
4. Find the `leaderboard` request
5. Click on it

### Check Request URL:
Should be:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
```

If mode=driving_game is MISSING, the frontend isn't sending it!

### Check Response:
- Preview tab: Should show `[]` (empty array)
- Headers tab: Look for `X-Total-Count: 0`

## üí° Most Likely Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Frontend Cache (80% likely)
**Symptoms:** Backend logs show correct filtering, but browser shows old data

**Fix:** Use a completely different browser or incognito mode

### Scenario 2: Frontend Not Rebuilt (15% likely)
**Symptoms:** Backend logs show mode is None or empty

**Fix:** 
```powershell
cd frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist
npm run build
# Copy dist to production
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Backend Instances (5% likely)
**Symptoms:** Logs don't appear when you click

**Fix:** 
- Kill ALL Python processes
- Start backend fresh
- Make sure only ONE is running

---

## ‚úÖ Action Items

1. [ ] Restart backend
2. [ ] Click "Driving Game" button
3. [ ] **Screenshot the backend console logs**
4. [ ] **Screenshot browser Network tab**
5. [ ] Share screenshots to diagnose

The logs will tell us EXACTLY where the problem is!

---

## üéØ Expected Working State

**Backend logs:**
```
[LEADERBOARD API CALLED]
  mode parameter: 'driving_game'
[FILTER APPLIED] Filtering by mode=driving_game
[TOTAL COUNT] 0 scores match the filter
```

**Frontend display:**
```
Total entries: 0
Showing: 0
"No entries yet"
```

**If logs show this but frontend shows 1356** ‚Üí It's 100% frontend caching. Use different browser!
