# 🚨 Frontend Not Calling Backend API

## Problem Identified
When you click "Driving Game", the backend console shows **NOTHING**. This means:
- ❌ Frontend is NOT making API calls
- ❌ Frontend is showing stale/cached data
- ❌ OR Frontend is using old built code

---

## 🔧 Fix: Rebuild Frontend

The frontend needs to be rebuilt with the new code:

### Step 1: Clean Build
```powershell
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\frontend

# Remove old build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build fresh
npm run build
```

### Step 2: If You're Running Dev Server
```powershell
cd Z:\llama3_20250528\llama3\Hackathon\prompt-portal\frontend

# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:5173/leaderboard

## 🔍 Diagnostic: Check What's Happening

### Open Browser Console:
1. Press `F12`
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Click "Driving Game"

### You should see logs like:
```
[BUTTON CLICK] Switching to mode: driving_game
[LEADERBOARD] useEffect triggered - mode changed to: driving_game
[LEADERBOARD] ===== LOADING DATA =====
[LEADERBOARD] Mode: driving_game
[API] Calling: /api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
[API] Response total: 0 entries: 0
[LEADERBOARD] ===== API RESPONSE =====
[LEADERBOARD] Total: 0
[LEADERBOARD] Entries: 0
```

### If you DON'T see these logs:
❌ Old frontend code is running
→ Need to rebuild

---

## 🌐 Check Network Tab

1. Press `F12`
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Click "Driving Game"
4. **Look for a request to `/api/leaderboard/`**

### If NO request appears:
❌ Frontend is not making the API call
❌ Possible causes:
- Old build is cached
- Service worker is caching old code
- Browser cache is very aggressive

---

## 🔥 Nuclear Option: Clear EVERYTHING

### 1. Clear Browser Data
```
Ctrl + Shift + Delete
→ Select "All time"
→ Check ALL boxes:
  ✓ Browsing history
  ✓ Cookies and site data
  ✓ Cached images and files
  ✓ Autofill form data
→ Clear data
```

### 2. Clear Service Workers
```
F12 → Application tab → Service Workers
→ Click "Unregister" for all
```

### 3. Disable Cache in DevTools
```
F12 → Network tab → Check "Disable cache"
Keep DevTools open while testing
```

### 4. Hard Reload Multiple Times
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (5 times)
```

## 📊 What Should Happen

### Backend Console (when you click Driving Game):
```
======================================================================
[LEADERBOARD API CALLED]
  mode parameter: 'driving_game'
  limit: 50, skip: 0
======================================================================
[FILTER APPLIED] Filtering by mode=driving_game
[TOTAL COUNT] 0 scores match the filter
```

### Frontend Console:
```
[BUTTON CLICK] Switching to mode: driving_game
[API] Calling: /api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
[API] Response total: 0 entries: 0
```

### Network Tab:
```
Request: GET /api/leaderboard/?limit=50&skip=0&mode=driving_game
Status: 200
Response: []
X-Total-Count: 0
```

### Browser Display:
```
Total entries: 0
Showing: 0
[No entries in table]
```

## ✅ Action Plan

1. **Check if frontend dev server is running**
   ```powershell
   # Is this running?
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **OR are you using a built version?**
   ```powershell
   # Then rebuild:
   npm run build
   ```

3. **After rebuild/restart:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Go to leaderboard
   - Click "Driving Game"
   - Watch console logs
   - Watch backend console
   - Watch Network tab

4. **Screenshot all three:**
   - Frontend console
   - Backend console
   - Network tab

This will show us EXACTLY what's happening!

## 💡 Most Likely Issue

**The frontend is serving OLD built code** that doesn't have the new API calls or logging.

**Solution:**
1. Stop frontend server
2. Clear dist folder
3. Rebuild
4. Start fresh
5. Hard refresh browser

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

Open this in browser console RIGHT NOW:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard/?mode=driving_game&limit=10')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('API Response:', d))
```

If this returns `[]` (empty array):
✅ Backend is working perfectly
❌ Frontend code is not calling the API

---

**Next Step:** Rebuild frontend and test with console logs!
