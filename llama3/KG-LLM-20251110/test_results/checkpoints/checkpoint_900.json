However, it's important to note that the **hibiscus** is more commonly recognized as Hawaii\u2019s official state flower, and it is often mistakenly referred to as the national flower. \n\nActually, **Hawaii does not have an official national flower** \u2014 it has a state flower, which is the **hibiscus** (specifically, *Hibiscus kokio* or *Hibiscus tiliaceus*). The **koa tree** is the state tree, not the state flower.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- **State flower**: Hibiscus\n- **State tree**: Koa tree\n- **National flower**: Not officially designated \u2014 so there is no official \u201cnational flower\u201d for Hawaii.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a flower that symbolizes Hawaii, the **hibiscus** is the most iconic and widely recognized.\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **Hibiscus** (state flower), *not officially designated as national flower*.",
