Later, he encounters an Ethiopian eunuch, a high-ranking official from the court of Queen Candace of Ethiopia, who was reading from the book of Isaiah. Philip explains the passage to him, baptizes him, and the eunuch continues on his journey (Acts 8:26\u201340).\n\nThus, Philip in Acts chapter 8 is a key early Christian evangelist and deacon who played a significant role in spreading Christianity beyond Jerusalem, including to Samaria and Ethiopia.",

    ],
    "Prediction": "The official currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican col\u00f3n (CRC). It is recommended to bring Costa Rican colones for most transactions, especially in local markets, restaurants, and small businesses. While some larger hotels, tour operators, and international businesses may accept US dollars, using colones is more practical and often results in better exchange rates. It's a good idea to exchange money upon arrival or withdraw colones from ATMs, which are widely available in cities and tourist areas.",

    "Prediction": "The term \"Supreme Court cases\" refers to legal cases that have been heard and decided by the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S. judicial system. These cases often involve significant constitutional questions, federal law, or disputes between states or between the federal government and individuals or states. Examples include *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954), which ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, and *Miranda v. Arizona* (1966), which established the Miranda rights. There are hundreds of such cases, and they are documented in legal databases like the U.S. Supreme Court's official website or legal resources such as Westlaw and LexisNexis.",

He was killed in a conflict with Native Hawaiians on February 14, 1779, on the island of Hawaii.\n\nCook is remembered for his scientific approach to exploration, his detailed maps, and his significant impact on European knowledge of the Pacific.
